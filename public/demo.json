  "transcript": "I want to convince you that technology is its own force that's pushing our culture in a very specific direction. I'm on Instagram, I'm just not present. I've probably spent half an hour just looking at the same stuff that I get. And we can predict what that direction is. We're living in big, big, big minds. It's the most important thing. We're constant pretenders. And we can steer it in a different direction before it's too late. I'm Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google, and I'm Eza Raskin. I helped build the open web at Mizzilla and invented the infinite scroll. As former tech insiders, we've seen and designed technology that hijacks our attention. But the problems go deeper than that. Technology can shape our thoughts, it can stoke feelings of envy, hatred, and social isolation, it can sew division, it can tear apart our shared sense of reality. These are all aspects of human downgrading, when technology dominates increasingly different parts of human nature. Human downgrading is the climate change of culture, solely pulling our thoughts, emotions, and what we think and believe on a daily basis in a more divisive direction. And like climate change, the result will be catastrophic. But unlike climate change, only a thousand people in Silicon Valley have to change what we're doing. In fact, we have yet to meet a single person in Silicon Valley who wants these outcomes, which means we're all actually on the same team. As co-founders of the Center for Humane Technology, we've met with the industry's leading executives, designers, programmers, and we've discovered in each of these meetings a pent-up desire to not just talk about these problems but to solve them. That's why, on June 10th, we're launching a new podcast called Your Undivided Attention. On Your Undivided Attention, we'll radically reimagine our technology ecosystem. We'll spark a conversation about how we can flip this from a race to the bottom to a race to the top. And to get there, we'll invite leading experts on human nature, the people that are most sophisticated about how we work. We'll talk to magicians, hypnotists, evolutionary biologists, the founder of the human potential movement of the 1960s. We'll talk to people who studied the dynamics of cults, the experts on children's development, conflict mediators, experts on election hacking around the world. There's no question whether Silicon Valley is sophisticated about technology. But what's been missing isn't more tech or better tech. The thing that's been missing is sophistication about human nature. You will soon. The father of sociobiology said, the real problem with humanity is that we have paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and godlike technology. We need to embrace our paleolithic emotions, uplift our medieval institutions, and give us the wisdom to wield our godlike technology. And that's what we'll be exploring on Your Undivided Attention. Our podcast premieres on June 10th. Subscribe today on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, or wherever you may listen.",

    "summary_feedback": "The speech is engaging, and the speakers, Tristan Harris and Eza Raskin, convincingly argue that technology is a driving force behind cultural shifts. They effectively use personal anecdotes and expert insights to highlight the problems of human downgrading caused by technology. However, the speech could benefit from more concise language, varied sentence structure, and a clearer narrative flow. The delivery is generally good, with a moderate pace and adequate vocal expressiveness, but there are areas for improvement, such as reducing filler words and increasing pitch variation to enhance audience engagement.",
    "text_suggestions": [
      "Consider condensing the speech to focus on key points, aiming for a more concise word count of around 400-450 words to improve overall clarity and impact.",
      "Analyze and minimize the use of filler words, which are currently absent in the provided transcript, but may have been present in the actual speech, to create a more polished and professional tone.",
      "Organize the content into clear sections or themes, using transitional phrases to guide the audience through the narrative and improve the overall flow of the speech."
    ],
    "voice_suggestions": [
      "The speaking rate of 150 words per minute is relatively fast; consider slowing down to around 125-135 words per minute to allow the audience to better absorb the information and follow the argument.",
      "While the pitch mean is within a suitable range, the pitch standard deviation is relatively high, indicating some variation in pitch; aim to maintain a more consistent and expressive tone to keep the audience engaged.",
      "The energy mean and standard deviation suggest a relatively consistent volume, but consider adding more dynamic range to emphasize key points and create a more captivating listening experience."
    ],
    "overall_score": 82,
    "recommendations": [
      "Practice the speech several times to reduce any filler words that may be present and to develop a more natural, conversational tone.",
      "Record yourself speaking and listen back to identify areas where you can improve vocal variety, such as by adding more inflection or emphasis on key words.",
      "Consider working with a speech coach or taking a public speaking course to enhance your content structure, delivery, and audience engagement skills.",
      "Focus on maintaining a consistent pace, pausing for emphasis, and using body language to add emphasis and engage the audience.",
      "Encourage audience participation by asking questions, using rhetorical devices, or incorporating storytelling techniques to create a more interactive and memorable experience."
