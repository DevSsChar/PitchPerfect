# Browser-Based Audio Analysis Feature

## Overview

This document describes the browser-based audio analysis feature implemented in the PitchPerfect application. This feature allows users to analyze their speech recordings directly in the browser without requiring server-side processing.

## Implementation Details

### Components Modified

1. **Record Component** (`components/record.jsx`)
   - Added browser-based audio analysis functionality
   - Implemented Web Audio API for audio processing
   - Added localStorage storage for analysis results

2. **User Dashboard Component** (`components/user-dashboard/xyx`)
   - Implemented the same browser-based analysis functionality
   - Ensures consistent analysis across different entry points

3. **History Component** (`components/history/history.jsx`)
   - Updated to display both server-side and browser-based analyses
   - Added toggle to switch between data sources
   - Enhanced visualization of analysis results

4. **API Routes**
   - Updated `/api/analyze` to accept browser-analyzed data
   - Updated `/api/history` to handle both types of analyses

### How It Works

1. **Audio Recording/Upload**:
   - Users can record audio directly in the browser or upload audio files
   - The audio is captured using the MediaRecorder API

2. **Browser Analysis**:
   - The recorded/uploaded audio is processed using the Web Audio API
   - Analysis includes:
     - Volume (RMS) calculation
     - Zero-crossing rate analysis (for pitch estimation)
     - Speech rate estimation
     - Filler word detection simulation
     - Overall score calculation

3. **Data Storage**:
   - Analysis results are stored in the browser's localStorage
   - Optionally sent to the server for database storage

4. **Visualization**:
   - Results are displayed in the History component with rich visuals
   - Users can toggle between server and browser analyses

## Technical Details

### Audio Analysis Metrics

- **Volume**: Calculated using Root Mean Square (RMS) of audio samples
- **Pace**: Estimated using zero-crossing rate as a proxy for speech rate
- **Filler Words**: Simulated detection (in a production environment, this would use more sophisticated algorithms)
- **Overall Score**: Weighted average of individual metric scores

### Data Format

The analysis results are stored in the following format:

```javascript
{
  id: "browser-analysis-[timestamp]",
  file_name: "[filename]",
  created_at: "[ISO timestamp]",
  audio_duration: [seconds],
  overall_score: [0-100],
  word_count: [estimated count],
  metrics: {
    volume: {
      rms: [value],
      score: [0-100]
    },
    pace: {
      wpm: [words per minute],
      score: [0-100]
    },
    filler_words: {
      count: { "um": [count], "uh": [count], ... },
      score: [0-100]
    },
    zero_crossing_rate: [value]
  },
  summary: "[generated summary]",
  analysis_type: "browser",
  audio_url: "[blob URL for playback]"
}
```

## Limitations

- Browser-based analysis is less accurate than server-side analysis with specialized models
- Some metrics (like filler word detection) are simulated rather than actually detected
- Audio processing in the browser may be resource-intensive for longer recordings
- Browser storage has limitations in size and persistence

## Future Improvements

- Implement more sophisticated audio analysis algorithms in WebAssembly
- Add real-time analysis during recording
- Improve filler word detection using pre-trained models
- Add more detailed visualizations of speech patterns
- Implement IndexedDB for more robust storage of analysis results
