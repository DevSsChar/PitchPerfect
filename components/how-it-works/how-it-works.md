# How PitchPerfect Works

## Overview
This page explains the three-step process that powers PitchPerfect's AI-driven presentation coaching. It helps users understand what happens after they record or upload their audio.

---

## Step 1: Record or Upload
- Users can record their presentation directly in the browser or upload an existing audio file (MP3, WAV, etc.).
- The system supports modern browsers and mobile devices.

## Step 2: AI Analysis
- The audio is sent to the backend, where it is transcribed using OpenAI Whisper.
- NLP analysis is performed to detect filler words, measure speaking pace, and assess vocal confidence.
- The backend returns a detailed JSON report with metrics, highlights, and improvement suggestions.

## Step 3: Instant Feedback
- Users receive a dashboard with:
  - Overall performance score
  - Speaking pace and filler word density
  - Confidence level
  - Personalized coaching tips
  - Transcript with highlights
- The feedback is actionable and easy to understand, helping users improve quickly.
