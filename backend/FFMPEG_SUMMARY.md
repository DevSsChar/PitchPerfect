# FFmpeg Installation for Whisper Transcription

## Issue Summary
The PitchPerfect application's Whisper transcription feature requires FFmpeg to process audio files, but FFmpeg is not currently installed or not in your system PATH.

## Files Created

1. **FFmpeg_Installation_Guide.md**
   - Comprehensive instructions for installing FFmpeg on Windows
   - Multiple installation methods (winget, manual download)
   - Steps to add FFmpeg to your PATH
   - Verification and troubleshooting tips

2. **check_ffmpeg.py**
   - Script to verify if FFmpeg is installed correctly
   - Tests Whisper transcription with the sample audio file
   - Provides detailed feedback and troubleshooting guidance

## Next Steps

1. **Install FFmpeg** by following the instructions in `FFmpeg_Installation_Guide.md`:
   - Download FFmpeg from one of the recommended sources
   - Extract the files to a location on your computer (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg`)
   - Add the bin directory to your PATH environment variable
   - Restart your terminal or IDE for the changes to take effect

2. **Verify the installation** by running:
   ```powershell
   ffmpeg -version
   ```
   You should see version information if FFmpeg is correctly installed.

3. **Test Whisper transcription** by running:
   ```powershell
   cd "c:/Users/shrey/Downloads/AI Analysis/PitchPerfect"
   python check_ffmpeg.py
   ```
   This will confirm if Whisper can now use FFmpeg for transcription.

4. **Run your original test script** to ensure everything works:
   ```powershell
   cd "c:/Users/shrey/Downloads/AI Analysis/PitchPerfect"
   python test_sample_wav.py
   ```

## Important Notes

- Restarting your terminal, IDE, or computer is essential after adding FFmpeg to PATH
- For Visual Studio Code, restart the entire application, not just the terminal
- If using a virtual environment, make sure to activate it before testing

Once FFmpeg is correctly installed and in your PATH, the Whisper transcription should work properly without falling back to the placeholder implementation.
